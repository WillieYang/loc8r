			platform and MongoDB as database) to develop that E-business web site, and \
			comparing all the components in MEAN stack with other corresponding techs in\

			experience to some degree. For instance, the pros and cons in relational\
			 database and NoSQL, the advantageous when using Node.js as server.'
